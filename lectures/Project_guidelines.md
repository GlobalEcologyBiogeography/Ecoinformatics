# Project guidelines

The course project is the perfect opportunity to practice skills that you have built and learn new ones specifically for your project. During the following weeks, you will be able to work on your projects at home and in-class where we will be able to guide you.

## Project submission

You need to create a Github repository with the name of your project, code and data. Include a README.md file, where you will describe the content and the process of your project.

For the last weeks of the term, you need to write weekly reports of the progress of your project on your README.md file. You can also write issues that you have encountered to help you figure out how to solve them.

The project is going to be evaluated based on six main components:

1. Download and cleaning
2. Manipulation
3. Exploration
4. Visualization
5. Analysis
6. The use of a new tool/extension/package in R that you have not used before.

Each of the above points must be included in your R code. Make sure to label each section accordingly.

## Special tools/extensions in R

1. Interactive maps with [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/raster.html) in R
2. Animations with [gganimate](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate)
3. Any ggplot [extensions](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/)
4. [rOpenSci Packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/)
4. Statistical analyses [see](http://moderndive.com/index.html)
