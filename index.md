This course provides a thorough introduction to the study of broad-scale patterns (in time, space,
and/or taxonomy) of biodiversity and the mechanisms that underlie them. This course also aims
to provide integrated training for analyses on large environmental and ecological datasets to build
a skillset of analytical techniques such as data wrangling, visualisation, and interpretation.

_The course website was adapted from Data Carpentry for Biologists website (http://www.datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/). As for their course material, instructors are welcome to modify and use this material for your own courses. I encourage collaborative development and contributions by other instructors, with the hopes that this will lead to better training and resources for everyone_.
