```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Project workflow

```{r, out.width = "300px",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figs/BES.png")
```


## Outline

1. Set up R and R studio
2. Install and set up a version control software
3. Set up an online version control account
4. Project folder structure
5. File naming system 


## 1. Set up R and R studio

```{r, out.width = "80px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../Figs/Rlogo.png")
```

https://r.project.org is the official R webpage

To download R, go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network. https://cran.r-project.org/ and simply click on the link for your operating system. 

```{r, out.width = "80px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../Figs/RStudioLogo.png")
```

To download RStudio, go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/


## 1. Set up R and R studio

```{r, out.width = "500px",fig.cap=paste("From Wickham and Grolemund, 2017"),fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../Figs/rstudio-workspace.png")
```


## 2. Install and set up a version control software

GitHub provides unlimited private repositories for educational users:
https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new

Your account needs to be associated with your Kenyon email address (@kenyon.edu)

## 3. Set up an online version control account

```{r, out.width = "400px",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../Figs/Github.png")
```

## 3. Join our classroom github repository

https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/34753325-ecoinformatics

## 3. Download and configure git on your machines

- Download git https://git-scm.com/downloads
- If you have windows also download gitbash

## 3. Download and configure git on your machines

- Open shell from Rstudio. Tools > Shell
- Configure git with your name and email address

```{bash,eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@domain.com
```

## 4. Project folder structure

1. Open the practical folder: https://github.com/GlobalEcologyBiogeography/Ecoinformatics

2. Select a working directory and extract the practical files

3. Open the R file (file1.R) in Rstudio

4. Run the code in the file


## Let's discuss!

1. Is the code reproducible?
2. How would you improve the code?
3. Are the files names informative?

## Working directory and portable code

### **Absolute path**
"C:/project_root_folder/data/species_dat.csv"

### **Relative path**
"data/species_dat.csv"

## RStudio projects

```{r,echo=FALSE, out.width = "500px",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../Figs/projects_new.png")
```


## Project folder structure (some tips)

* Separate your code into pipeline chunks

```{r, out.width = "800px",fig.cap=paste("From Joseph V. Casillas, 2015"),fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figs/pipeline1.png")
```

 
* Comment your data and code
* Separate temporal working data from raw data

## 5. File naming system

```{r, out.width = "600px",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figs/Folder_structure.png")
```
